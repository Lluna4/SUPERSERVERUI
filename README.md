# SUPERSERVERUI
This is a project whose goal is to make a minecraft server creator understandable for everyone with little knowing about that

The project is in spanish but it will be translated soon, also the commit notes are in spanish to understand that myself better, i can change them later.

The parts of this code are:
- Version selected (now only spigot is supported)
- Difficulty selection
- Gamemode selection
- The ip is written automaticly
- Asks if it wants the sycro with google drive
